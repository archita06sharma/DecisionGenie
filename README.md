## ✨ Why DecisionGenie?

We all hit those moments when logic, mood, and motivation just don’t align.

**DecisionGenie acts as a spark — not a crutch**.  
It breaks decision paralysis with randomness that still respects your priorities through weights.

Because sometimes the best way to move forward... is to just move.
